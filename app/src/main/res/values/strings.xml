        Hi, thank you so much for downloading this app!\n\n

        I also would like to this chance for introducing myself. My name is <b>Aruan√£ Kaique Ferreira</b>, and I am a software engineer that moved to
        Germany less than year ago with my wife\n\n

        I have over ten years of experience working as a developer, I have worked through many industries and technologies, from writing sensor drivers in
        C++ to write Java backend system to big financial institutions and lots of other stuff until I started worked with mobile 6 years ago, mostly with
        Android\n\n

        I created this app with two purposes: first to serve as a lab where I can test new things in the Android world and second as a showcase of
        technical knowledge.\n\n

        My goal is to always add new feature in this app whenever I feel like learning something new. Right now this app makes use of Android new
        <b>navigation component</b>, the <b>Architecture components</b>, <b>Dagger 2</b> and a few <b>material</b> transitions.\n\n

        In the near future I will be adding a few networking features with Retrofit and also cover all the app with tests\n\n

        Also, I tried to show here my view on a good architecture for and Android app. I followed and <b>MVVM</b> approach along with <b>use cases</b> and
        <b>repositories</b>.
        I believe that at this moment, this is one of the cleanest architectures one can use for building an app right now.\n\n
