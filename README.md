 I created this app with two purposes: first to serve as a lab where I can test new things in the Android world and second as a showcase of technical knowledge
 
 My goal is to always add new feature in this app whenever I feel like learning something new. Right now this app makes use of Android new <b>navigation component</b>, the <b>Architecture components</b>, <b>Dagger 2</b> and a few <b>material</b> transitions.

 In the near future I will be adding a few networking features with Retrofit and also cover all the app with tests

 Also, I tried to show here my view on a good architecture for and Android app. I followed and <b>MVVM</b> approach along with <b>use cases</b> and <b>repositories</b>.I believe that at this moment, this is one of the cleanest architectures one can use for building an app right now
